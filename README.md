### Build with

### What I learned

This is my first website  where I used "Display:Grid" that makes for me easy to make the Website more suitable for any kind of devices. Olso I emproved my Flex-box skills and I tryied in this project to style the elements with "Pseudo Classes" and create some of elements with ::Before and :After which was for me olso new experience.
